Learning bash and git

challenge.sh 
Prompts user for a name
In the current directory, it will create 25 empty named: name1-25
If there are already files with the same format, like name25, it will continue from there..
Like name26-50 for example.

It does throw an error for the script file, but the script will still run without issue
